## Lehman College Data Science Initiative

There's a lot of data science going on at Lehman College! 

Courses in many departments include data science material, such as learning R or Python, working with real world data,
and doing original projects. 

This spring you can take our newest course: *Math 128 Foundations of Data Science*  with Prof. Megan Owen.  
Sociology majors can also take this course as *SOC 251 Special Topics, Data Science for Sociology*.

You can also learn R this Spring in SOC 345 and SOC 339.

### Coming this spring: A minor!
