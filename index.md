## Lehman College Data Science Initiative

There's a lot of data science going on at Lehman College! 

Courses in many departments include data science material, such as learning R or Python, working with real world data,
and doing original projects. 

This spring we are offering: *Math 128 Foundations of Data Science*  with Prof. Megan Owen.  

In Fall 2019 we will offer both Math 128 and SOC 3470 Reasoning with data.

You can also learn R in SOC 345 and other classes (such as American Demography).
