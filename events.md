# Women in Data Science Conference: The Bronx

The Data Science Initiative is sponsoring a satellite WiDS conference at Lehman on March 5, 2018!

This is a fantastic conference at [Stanford](http://www.widsconference.org)  and we will be streaming it 
all day, with live speakers from 3:30 to 5 in the Music Building.

Our live speakers are six amazing women in data science based in New York City. They come from a wide
variety of backgrounds and work in diverse domains, from the study of disease ecology to the study
of the geography of poverty to the economic impact of Obamacare.
